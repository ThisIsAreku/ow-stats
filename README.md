# OW-stats

Parse stats from the Overwatch website

Inspired by https://github.com/SunDwarf/OWAPI

## Informations

For now, this project aim to closely match the json structure of OWAPI. The goal is to have a lightweight library capable of parsing the Overwatch website,
and can act as a drop-in replacements for statistics collection.

The schema might change in the future.
